# Learn MS SQL With Me
Hi All,

I have created two exciting projects: SQL Basic and SQL Project.

SQL Basic: This project covers the fundamentals of SQL, including basic commands and database concepts. It's designed for beginners who are just starting out with SQL and want to build a solid foundation. I will be continuously adding new information and examples to help you learn and practice SQL effectively.

SQL Project: This project focuses on real-life SQL applications, where we'll work with actual data to gain insights from databases. It's aimed at intermediate-level users who want to apply their SQL knowledge to practical scenarios and enhance their skills. Stay tuned for regular updates and new data sets that will challenge and improve your SQL abilities.

Join these projects to start your SQL journey or to take your skills to the next level. Let's learn and grow together!
